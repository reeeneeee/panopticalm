# Panopticalm

Panopticalm is a web app for playing (humorous) guided meditations with enforced eye closure. 

For the first 5 minutes of each meditation, the audio plays only when the webcam detects that the listener's eyes are closed. When at least one is open, the audio stops and the screen goes gray.
After 5 minutes, they continue to play automatically.
